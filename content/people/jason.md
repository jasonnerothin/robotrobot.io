Jason is Senior Technical Account Manager with [GigaSpaces Technologies](http://gigaspaces.com), where he has worked for the last 5+ years. He has worked with dozens of development teams around the world, teaching them the nuances of distributed in-memory computing. 
 
On a lark, Jason founded the [Ranger Computing & Robotics Club](https://www.facebook.com/groups/rangercomputeclub/) at his children's school.

While still actively participating in the "RCRC" effort, he has gone on to found [RobotRobot.io](/), where he now serves as Chief Experience Officer.
